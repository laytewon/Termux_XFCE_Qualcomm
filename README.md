# Termux_XFCE

Fork from fork https://github.com/bengkelgawai/Termux_XFCE to optimize GPU renderer performance in **Qualcomm Snapdragon** devices. You can also test it in other mobile APU, but I don't think it wil work properly.

Requirement is fresh debian proot-distro, fresh termux installation is also preferred.

Install with :
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laytewon/Termux_XFCE_Qualcomm/main/setup.sh -o setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```
